Frequently Asked Questions about the API Network

**Question #1**
What was the inspiration behind creating the API Network?

**Answer #1**

There is this huge wealth of knowledge today on the internet. However much of the most valuable information is personal, not public in nature. For example its nice I can Google the weather in Bali, however since I live in Austin the weather in my own city is much more interesting to me. The key to unlocking this information in the applications I use, is to first connect my personal data to publicly available information. Meaning if we can break down the walled gardens of Google and Facebook and just take our data with us where ever we go, that would be really powerful. That's where the inspiration for the API Network comes in. With an open source market for all of the APIs that people use, all of sudden we can unleash developers to build much more powerful applications for users, no matter what websites they use or walled gardens they currently live in. Its about taking out and middle men. Its about empowering people with their own data.

**Question #2**

Does the API Network pay programmers for listing / hosting API's?

**Answer #2**

Programmers that host APIs on the Network will get paid XAP by those that choose to use their service. The API Network will  also reward programmers with XAP for listing their APIs on the open marketplace (in proportion to how popular their APIs are). The concept is to get as many useful APIs listed on the marketplace as possible and standardize the way users can access the data. And since the standard is open source it will let developers customize the information they receive and thus build more powerful applications. In short API hosts get rewarded, and users get a better service.
