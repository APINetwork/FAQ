Frequently Asked Questions about the API Network

**Question #1**

What was the inspiration behind creating the API Network?

**Answer #1**

There is this huge wealth of knowledge today on the internet. However much of the most valuable information is personal, not public in nature. For example its nice I can Google the weather in Bali, however since I live in Austin the weather in my own city is much more interesting to me. The key to unlocking this information in the applications I use, is to first connect my personal data to publicly available information. Meaning if we can break down the walled gardens of Google and Facebook and just take our data with us where ever we go, that would be really powerful. That's where the inspiration for the API Network comes in. With an open source market for all of the APIs that people use, all of sudden we can unleash developers to build much more powerful applications for users, no matter what websites they use or walled gardens they currently live in. Its about taking out and middle men. Its about empowering people with their own data.

**Question #2**

Does the API Network pay programmers for listing / hosting API's?

**Answer #2**

Programmers that host APIs on the Network will get paid XAP by those that choose to use their service. The API Network will  also reward programmers with XAP for listing their APIs on the open marketplace (in proportion to how popular their APIs are). The concept is to get as many useful APIs listed on the marketplace as possible and standardize the way users can access the data. And since the standard is open source it will let developers customize the information they receive and thus build more powerful applications. In short API hosts get rewarded, and users get a better service.

**Question #3**

Would the API Network be cross-compatible with systems such as Maidsafes' SAFE Network?  If so, do the XAP coins become redundant next to safecoins?  Or would they be complimentary to each other?

**Answer #3**

You can think of the API Network as a front end user interface to back end systems such as the SAFE Network. So as MaidSafe' SAFE Network gets closer to its production version, it may present a great option for storing the data for the hosted APIs on the API Network and so the API core devs are eager to make the two system compatible. In fact storing API data on the SAFE Network would generate SAFE coins (as part of their third party content creation reward pool) which the API Network would pass on to those listing APIs through its interface. So the SAFE and API Networks compliment each other and the digital tokens are meant to work together in different layers.


**Question #4**

Is the API Network up and running or is this crowdsale mainly for funding its infrastructure?

**Answer #4**

The goal of the crowdsale is to get as many developers and programmers aware of the API Network as possible. So its largely a 30 day educational and learning process where we are introducing the project first to the crypto currency community because of all the startups and development going on here. The API Network already has a great deal of code up and running and developers are welcome to come test it out at the demo site: https://docs.apinetwork.co/ The support collected from the crowdsale will be used to further develop of the API Network clients and bring as much proprietary code into the world of open source as possible.

**Question #5**

What are the upcoming development tasks for the API Network?

**Answer #5**

There are many upcoming tasks on our [Development Roadmap](./Roadmap.md)

**Question #6**

How many XAP coins will there be?  Are they distributed automatically in the protocol?

**Answer #6**

At the end of the crowdsale 5,000,000 XAP will exist. 3,000,000 XAP will have been generated automatically by the crowdsale participants and 2,000,000 XAP that will be generated for buying proprietary code and open sourcing it. The protocol also sets aside other reward pools for third party developers (2,000,000 XAP), core developers (2,000,000 XAP) and node providers (1,000,000 XAP) all of which is defined in the protocol and will be automated as much as possible. Ultimately, no more than 10,000,000 XAP will ever exist. 

Though it will take many years for the protocol's algorithms to distribute the different pools of tokens. See details in the whitepaper: https://github.com/APINetwork/ProtocolSpec#total-distribution-of-apicoins-xap

**Question #7**

What platform are the XAP tokens being issued on, and how can I get some?

**Answer #7**

The XAP tokens are being issued using the Master Protocol technology for creating them on top of Bitcoin's cryptographic ledger. Purchasing some XAP is as simple as sending a bitcoin transaction to the API Network generation address see more at: http://buyxap.com/ Seeing and sending your XAP after the crowdsale is as easy as using the using the multi currency Omni Wallet: https://test.omniwallet.org/

**Question #8**

How is the API Network going to be used in the Bitcoin eco-system?  I saw Kozeni API by Hive and Humint is one of the first related intergrations.

**Answer #8**

The API devs believe there will be a number of different bitcoin applications that will leverage the API network. One of the first examples is an API to support sending and receiving different types of cryto-tokens. One project in particular called the "Kozeni API" by Hive and Humint will provide basic send/receive/balance support for all crypto-tokens supported by the network, irrespective of whether they are metacoins or running on a unique blockchain. Their goal is to see that newly created tokens would be able to be added to the network and immediately be available for use in wallets and other apps.

One can imagine innumerable use cases including: bitcoin price data, news feeds, secure log in, shopping and merchant APIs.

**Question #9**

Why doesn't Alice accept bitcoins for her API service?

**Answer #9** 

Ease, Discovery, and Competition

Alice could accept bitcoin directly. But unless she wants to do that manually, she will have to set up a payment mechanism, read Bitpay or the like which is extra work for her. 

There is also the discovery issue. Yes, Alice sets up API and use BitPay to take in BTC, But how does Bob find Alice's API? He spends time looking through all the websites, seeing which ones offer the API he needs, maybe stumbles upon Alice's API and decides to use it. 

Lastly, there is the competition issue. If Bob only has one option for his API provider, then his application is fragile. Every time Alice changes her API (which could be often) then Bob must fix the now broken data coming into his site. If instead Alice, Fay, and Georgia are offering the Bitcoin to Dogecoin price ticker API, then Alice better treat Bob, Charlie, Dan, and Ethan well or they will choose to switch providers to Fay or Georgia instead. In summary, Ease, Discovery, and Competition are really critical here.

A similar example we can look at in the real world is why Overstock.com (a huge company) doesn't just do their own bitcoin merchant services. Why use Coinbase or Bitpay? Overstock could do it themselves. But ease, discovery and competition play similar roles in that decision too. So if Coinbase charges a 1% fee or has me use Coinbase token either way its easier for Overstock than doing everything themselves.

**Question #10**

"If the coins are not sold out by the end of crowd sale on July 18th, what will happen to the remaining XAP from the 3,000,000 crowdsale pool?

**Answer #10**

See the section above titled Crowdsale APICoin XAP Generation in the notes sub section. https://github.com/APINetwork/ProtocolSpec#the-crowdsale-apicoin-xap-generation

"If the full 3,000,000 APICoins (XAP) are not generated during the crowdsale event, the remaining portion will be generated and distributed to the participants of the crowdsale on a proportional basis. Meaning that if for example a purchaser brought 1 APICoin (XAP) for 1.6 mBTC during the first segment of the crowdsale, and the crowdsale sold 1,000,000 APICoins (XAP) (out of the possible 3,000,000) then all holders of 1 APIcoin (XAP) would gain 2 additional APIcoins (XAP) and in this example the purchaser would end up with 3 APIcoins (XAP)."
