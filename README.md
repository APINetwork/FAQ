Frequently Asked Questions about the API Network

**Question #1**
What was the inspiration behind creating the API Network?

**Answer #1**

There is this huge wealth of knowledge today on the internet. However much of the most valuable information is personal, not public in nature. For example its nice I can Google the weather in Bali, however since I live in Austin the weather in my own city is much more interesting to me. The key to unlocking this information in the applications I use, is to first connect my personal data to publicly available information. Meaning if we can break down the walled gardens of Google and Facebook and just take our data with us where ever we go, that would be really powerful. That's where the inspiration for the API Network comes in. With an open source market for all of the APIs that people use, all of sudden we can unleash developers to build much more powerful applications for users, no matter what websites they use or walled gardens they currently live in. Its about taking out and middle men. Its about empowering people with their own data.

**Question #2**

Does the API Network pay programmers for listing / hosting API's?

**Answer #2**

Programmers that host APIs on the Network will get paid XAP by those that choose to use their service. The API Network will  also reward programmers with XAP for listing their APIs on the open marketplace (in proportion to how popular their APIs are). The concept is to get as many useful APIs listed on the marketplace as possible and standardize the way users can access the data. And since the standard is open source it will let developers customize the information they receive and thus build more powerful applications. In short API hosts get rewarded, and users get a better service.

**Question #3**

Would the API Network be cross-compatible with systems such as Maidsafes' SAFE Network?  If so, do the XAP coins become redundant next to safecoins?  Or would they be complimentary to each other?

**Answer #3**

You can think of the API Network as a front end user interface to back end systems such as the SAFE Network. So as MaidSafe' SAFE Network gets closer to its production version, it may present a great option for storing the data for the hosted APIs on the API Network and so the API core devs are eager to make the two system compatible. In fact storing API data on the SAFE Network would generate SAFE coins (as part of their third party content creation reward pool) which the API Network would pass on to those listing APIs through its interface. So the SAFE and API Networks compliment each other and the digital tokens are meant to work together in different layers.


**Question #4**
Why doesn't Alice accept bitcoins for her API service?


**Answer #4** 

Ease, Discovery, and Competition

Alice could accept bitcoin directly. But unless she wants to do that manually, she will have to set up a payment mechanism, read Bitpay or the like which is extra work for her. 

There is also the discovery issue. Yes, Alice sets up API and use BitPay to take in BTC, But how does Bob find Alice's API? He spends time looking through all the websites, seeing which ones offer the API he needs, maybe stumbles upon Alice's API and decides to use it. 

Lastly, there is the competition issue. If Bob only has one option for his API provider, then his application is fragile. Every time Alice changes her API (which could be often) then Bob must fix the now broken data coming into his site. If instead Alice, Fay, and Georgia are offering the Bitcoin to Dogecoin price ticker API, then Alice better treat Bob, Charlie, Dan, and Ethan well or they will choose to switch providers to Fay or Georgia instead. In summary, Ease, Discovery, and Competition are really critical here.

A similar example we can look at in the real world is why Overstock.com (a huge company) doesn't just do their own bitcoin merchant services. Why use Coinbase or Bitpay? Overstock could do it themselves. But ease, discovery and competition play similar roles in that decision too. So if Coinbase charges a 1% fee or has me use Coinbase token either way its easier for Overstock than doing everything themselves.

**Question #5**

"If the coins are not sold out by the end of crowd sale on July 18th, what will happen to the remaining XAP from the 3,000,000 crowdsale pool?

**Answer #5**

See the section above titled Crowdsale APICoin XAP Generation in the notes sub section. https://github.com/APINetwork/ProtocolSpec#the-crowdsale-apicoin-xap-generation

"If the full 3,000,000 APICoins (XAP) are not generated during the crowdsale event, the remaining portion will be generated and distributed to the participants of the crowdsale on a proportional basis. Meaning that if for example a purchaser brought 1 APICoin (XAP) for 1.6 mBTC during the first segment of the crowdsale, and the crowdsale sold 1,000,000 APICoins (XAP) (out of the possible 3,000,000) then all holders of 1 APIcoin (XAP) would gain 2 additional APIcoins (XAP) and in this example the purchaser would end up with 3 APIcoins (XAP)."
